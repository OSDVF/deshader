# Deshader low-level API
Deshader can be controlled from the host application code. All the API header files are autogenerated and they expose all [Deshader library commands](Commands.md).

## Unobtrusive Commands

`deshader/macros.h` wraps Deshader commands in a set of macros. The commands are implemented as `glObjectLabel` and `glDebugMessageInsert` calls. They can be used in any C or C++ code without any additional setup and do not require Deshader to be linked to the application.

## C API
Using direct C API requires your application to be linked to Deshader library (`.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib`). 
`deshader/deshader.h` exposes a C API for more advanced control over Deshader. It includes all the commands from the [remote command interface](Commands.md).

## Zig API
Deshader installation also includes `deshader/deshader.zig` and `deshader/deshader_prefixed.zig`. The prefixed version includes all the commands with the word `deshader` prefixed to them.
