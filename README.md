# Deshader ðŸ”¦
Shaders are often shiny but sometimes also shady, fishy and stinky!
> What if I could just step-debug that shader as I do with my CPU programs?

Now you can!
Deshader intercepts OpenGL calls and adds instrumentation code to your shaders so you don't need to create your own debug visualizations to output shader execution process.
You can also:
# Features
- Track variable values for different output primitives and pixels
- Incrementally visualise primitive and pixel output (so you can fix that weird vertex!)
- Use inbuilt editor (VSCode for Web in an embedded window or at `http://localhost:8080/index.html` by default)
- Run it on Linux and Windows

# Goals
- Compatibility between OpenGL vendor implementations (ICDs)
- Being better than GLIntercept

## Non-goals
And also some dead ends that have been encountered.
- Debugging other languages than GLSL (feel free to fork and add your own language)
- Using vendor-specific GPU APIs and instructions
- Assembly level debugging
- Profiling
- Mac OS CGL Support
- [Custom WebView profile data directory](https://github.com/webview/webview/issues/719)

Feel free to fork and add your own goals or even better, break the non-goals!

Deshader aims to assist researchers who want to leverage the edge features of graphical APIs to explore and create new software technologies. There is no development effort given into features like debugging of third party applications.

# Build
## Components

Deshader consists of several (mostly third party; mostly forked) components that require different dev stacks and frameworks. Some of them are installed as git submodules or as Zig dependencies.

- Deshader library
    - [/src/](/src/)
    - Written in **Zig**
    - [Graphical API bindings](https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-opengl)
        - Code generator written in **C#** [/libs/zig-opengl/](/libs/zig-opengl/)
    - [Web View (WebKit2Gtk)](https://github.com/ziglibs/positron) [/libs/positron/](/libs/positron/)
    - Example application
        - [/example/](/example/)
    - [GLSL Analyzer](https://github.com/nolanderc/glsl_analyzer) [/libs/positron/](/libs/positron/)
- [Visual Studio Code for Web distribution](https://github.com/Felx-B/vscode-web)
    - [/editor/](/editor/)
    - With node.js packages
    - Managed by **Bun**
- VSCode extension
    - [/editor/deshader-vscode/](/editor/deshader-vscode/)
    - With node.js packages
    - Managed by **Bun** and bundled by Webpack

## Requirements
- Zig [Installation](https://github.com/ziglang/zig#installation) (developed against 0.12.0-dev.899+027aabf49)
- Bun 1.0.6 [Install](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun#install)
- Dotnet
- C libraries
    - Linux
        - gtk-3 and webkit2gtk
    - Windows
        - [Edge Dev Channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download)

## How to
After you install all the required frameworks, clone this repository with submodules, open terminal in its folder and create a debug build by
```sh
git clone  --recurse-submmodules https://github.com/OSDVF/deshader
cd deshader
zig build dependencies
```
If that does not output any errors, it will autmatically
- Generate OpenGL bindings
    - `make` inside `/libs/zig-opengl/`
- Install Node.js dependencies
    - `bun install` inside `/editor/` and `/editor/deshader-vscode/`
- Compile Deshader VSCode Extension
    - `bun compile-web` inside `/editor/deshader-vscode/`

for you. If there weren't any errors, then you can
```sh
zig build deshader
```
Btw. `zig build` just downloads dependencies in `build.zig.zon`.
## Options
Specify options as `-Doption=value` to `zig build deshader` commands. See also `zig build --help`
Name                         | Values                        | Description
-----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`linkage`                    | `Static`, `Dynamic` (default) | Select type of for deshader library
`GlAddLoader`         | any string                    | Specify a single additional function name that will be exported and intercepted by Deshader.
`VkAddDeviceLoader`   | any string                    | Export additional function that will be intercepted and will call device procedure addresss loader
`VkAddInstanceLoader` | any string                    | Same as `VkAddDeviceLoader` but for instance procedure addresses
 
### Production build
- Add `-Doptimize` to `zig build` commands
    - `-Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` will disable debug and info meassages
    - `-Doptimize=ReleaseSafe` will will enable info meassages
    - `-Doptimize=Debug` (default) will include debug, info, warning and error meassages

## Frequently Seen Errors
- Cannot compile
    - Something with `struct_XSTAT` inside WolfSSL
        - fix by `./fix_wolfssl.sh`  
        **CAUTION**: The script searches the whole `zls` global cache and deletes lines with `struct_XSTAT` so be careful.
- Editor window is blank
    - This is a known issue between WebKit and vendor GL drivers
    - Disable GPU acceleration
        - Set environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1`
    - Or select a different GPU
        - by setting `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only`
        - or `DRI_PRIME=1`
    
and finally get your Deshader library files from `./zig-out/`:

- lib
    - (lib)deshader.[a|so|dll|lib|dylib]
- include
    - deshader.h
    - deshader.hpp
    - deshader.zig

The files inside `include/` are bindings for your application.

# Example
```sh
zig build example # Builds example application
./zig-out/bin/example # Runs example application
```

# Settings
